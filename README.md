  ## Your task
  
            Spend no more than three hours making improvements to this page.
            When you've reached the time limit, zip up the entire project folder and send it back to us.

            We're open to any changes you decide to make. Feel free to add files and adjust anything that's here.
            You might choose to identify and fix bugs, make general code improvements, write documentation,
            improve performance, introduce entirely new features, or do something else we haven't anticipated!
            Please provide a brief rationale for your changes in code comments, or right here in the
            markup for the page.

            Please note that there are no "gotchas" or "correct" answers. Rather, we're
            hoping to get a general feel for how you might respond and contribute to
            preliminary work from another colleague.

            We should be able to run your submission on a local web server without needing to invoke any
            installation or build commands. For example, we should be able to evaluate your submission
            without needing to run npm install (or similar) commands. You should feel free to use
            third-party libraries. If you include a git repository with your submission, we will take a
            look at your commit history.


## My Changes

Here I created an interactive Assistant UI to help guide the user through the learning experience:

To find the code associated with the steps search for steps (ie. Step 1) in your code editor.

Step 1:

Prompts the user to hover inside the xy-pad. 

Step 2:

Prompts the user to press and hold the xy-pad to hear the audio sample. 

Step 3:

Prompts user to move the pointer along the axis to hear the changes in cutoff frequency and playback rate. Note appearance of tooltips for cutoff frequency and playback rate for further keyword description.
